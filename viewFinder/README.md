- Similar to this: [Keywing Phone lens kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DQRKY6D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- For a wider FOV you can try finding these:
    - [Deathlens Fisheye](https://www.deathdigital.com/collections/all/products/fisheye-lens-iphone-14) I don't know if they changed their design since I made this viewfinder.
     
	    or    
    - [Lemuro Fisheye](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lemuro-Fisheye-8mm-Lens-Silver/dp/B07VYL3XXR?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1) They're no longer in stock with retailers but you can find them on eBay or the like. 

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.6 tap
- M2 drill bit
- M2 tap
- M3 drill bit
- M3 tap

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble.

Drill out M1.6 holes to 1.4mm before tapping with the M1.6 tap. 

The viewfinder can be completely done with FDM 3D printing. If you want a better fit and finish send the 'forCNC' STP/STEP files to get machined. Depending on what you print you'll need to secure the front element with 3-4 M2 set screws. There are two coldshoe sizes and you can use either for the standard ~170 viewfinder. They secure with M3 machine screws.

The optics needed are from the 198 Degree fisheye lens and the 120 degree wide angle lens. Please refer to the supplied assembly STP file to see their orientation. For the wider FOV viewfinder you need to locate a Deathlens fisheye lens or a Lemuro fisheye lens. Again please refer to the _assembly.stp file for lens orientation. if using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.
