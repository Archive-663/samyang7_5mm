### Background Story:
I recently picked up a Minolta CL to design a few things for. When I was looking at the Leica M mount there wasn't a native circular fisheye. This is my attempt to rectify that error. This lens has no coding or focus coupling, but works perfectly well with my Minolta CL. The flange focal distance of the Leica M mount is 27.80mm while the MFT flange focal distance is 19.25mm. This meant that I had to shave off 8.55mm from the Samyang body. Removing the MFT mount wasn't enough so I had to reverse engineedr the focus track and shave off an additional 2-3mm from the focusing track while making sure I didn't interfere with the original functions. Once I verified the function through SLA printing, I sent the focus track to get cnc'ed. Everything else was 3d printed because the core functionality relied on the focus track being correct and the fidelity of FDD printing and even SLA printing isn't great when you want accuracy and strength. 

The problem was creating a viewfinder with off the shelf parts. Now I know what you're thinking, how am I going to solve this problem with no experience with designing optics. Well, it's pretty simple -- smartphone lenses. So, the first idea I had was to see if the fisheye filters for slr lenses would work. And to a certain extent they did, but the size was not acceptable. I assumed these lens filters would work because they don't change the focusing characteristics of the lenses I tried. This is more pronounced on smartphones. I figured the filters would have reletively deep depth of focus and everything would be in focus. So I picked up a cheap generic set of smartphone lenses and freelensed a basic circular fisheye viewfinder. Then 3D printed and repeated until I had an acceptable viewfinder.
