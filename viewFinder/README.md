### What would be helpful:

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Please view the supplied assembly STP file to see how the lens should be assembled.

The viewfinder can be completely done with FDM 3D printing. If you want a better fit and finish send the 'forCNC' STP/STEP files to get machined. Depending on what you print you'll need to secure the front element with 3-4 M2 set screws. There are two coldshot sizes and you can use either for the standard ~180 viewfinder. They secure with M3 machine screws.
