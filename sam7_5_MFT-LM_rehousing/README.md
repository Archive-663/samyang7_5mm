### Features:
- The most compact full circular fisheye lens for any 135 film SLR camera system. 
- Redesigned Focus Track to allow for infinity focus
- Customizeable Focus, Aperture, and Indicator Rings

### What you'll need:
- 7 x M1.7 x 5mm Pan Head Machine Screw
- 1 x M2 x 3mm set screw (grub scre)
- ~50mm x 12mm x 0.5mm brass bar/sheet

### What would be helpful:
- M2 drill bit
- M2 tap
- A Dremel w/cutoff wheel
- Microfiles

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Please view the supplied assembly STP file to see how the lens should be assembled.

I don't recommend you use a 3D printed focus track. Send the STP/STEP file off to get CNC'ed for you. You may need to fine tune fitment after wards.

THe aperture arm should not be used if printed. Use it as an example of how your aperture arm should look. Transfer the template file onto 0.5mm brass. Cut to template line. Fold on template divots. Sand until fitment is correct. Install and mark the hole from the aperture ring. Drill the hole and secure with an M2 x 3mm set screw.
